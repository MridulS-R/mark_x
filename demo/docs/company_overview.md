# MarkX Company Overview

MarkX builds a pragmatic, flexible knowledge search for teams. It ingests text and markdown, chunks content, embeds with pluggable providers, and serves hybrid semantic + keyword search. A simple CLI powers ingest, sync, prune, search, reconstruct, extract, and chat.

Our focus is developer productivity and reliability: fast indexing, portable storage, and clear logs. Projects are isolated, and results can be exported.
